Change management is an important part of software development.
If not treated properly, change can lead to resentment from developers, system administrators, and can introduce bug to customers.

Building and failing fast is good but building needs to be aligned with right process so as to enable predictability and management.

To implement Devops, a lot of process and cultural change needs to occur within 
an organization. 

Tools are meaningless if there is no change in the way people who do the work do 
work.

What we hope to achieve if you follow through this process are the following:
1. Manage projects on github using Github Project 
2. Create milestones, Issues, and use social programming to build transperancy
3. Create different deployment environments so as to isolate changes 
4. Integrate testing as a key aspect of the development workflow
5. Automate the entire software delivery process.
